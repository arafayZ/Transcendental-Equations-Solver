🔢 Transcendental Equation Solver

A Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) to solve transcendental equations using multiple numerical methods.

✨ Features

Supports Bisection, Regula Falsi, Newton-Raphson, Muller, Secant methods

GUI for user-friendly interaction

Input complex functions: Sin, Cos, Tan, Ln, √

Shows roots, iterations, and graphs

Options: Solve, Clear, Function Buttons for quick input

🛠️ Technologies

Language: Python

Libraries: Tkinter (GUI), Matplotlib (Graphs), NumPy (Calculations)

📌 How It Works

Enter a transcendental equation in the input box.

Choose a method (e.g., Newton-Raphson).

Press Solve to compute the root.

View the iterations and graph of the function.

Use Clear to reset and solve a new equation.

🎯 Example Functions
sin(x) - x/2  
cos(x) - log(x+1)  
x^2 - sqrt(x+3)
